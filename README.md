# Mouse-Location
Java Program that displays the X, Y location of the mouse 

I made this program so I could find the mouse location when using the Robot class in Java. This is useful for making demos or any sort of automation using the Robot class.

Please feel free to copy the code and use as you wish.

Download the jar and use as needed.
