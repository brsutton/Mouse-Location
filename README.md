# Mouse-Location
Java Program that displays the X, Y location of the mouse 

I made this program so I could find the mouse location when using the Robot class in Java. This is useful for making demos or any sort of automation using the Robot class.

I used a thread so I could make the location update every 100ms. If you have it constantly update the program uses a lot of resources.

Please feel free to copy the code and use as you wish.
